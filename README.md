# Zekkie's wacky website

## JS

This site is not working without JS. Why? Because it was build with pure JS.

### Solution

This site should be rendered serverside and served as plain html to the user

## Cookies/LocalStorage

No cookies/LS has been used. My site does not use any of these tech

## No mouse/trackpad

Oops, all elements are clickable div's. So it will not respond on anything else but clicks. And even then, there are no focus states available. 

### Solution

Make actual buttons/anchors out of the elements. So the user can actually interact with the website. Add focus states, maybe even acces keys. Tabindex?

## Color

The contrast is good so no changes needed here

## Images

Nothing to see here, just text.

## Custom fonts

Naah, oldschool Arial with sans-serif fallbacks.


# TODO

	- Accesibilty is pretty wack, so much work is needed on that subject
	- The website has to be rendered on a server to serve plain html to the user
	- TEST WITH SCREENREADERS AND ON WACKY DEVICES/BROWSERS
